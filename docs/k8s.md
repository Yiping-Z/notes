self-healing systems 

decoupling: easy to scale the programs

- <b>Pods</b>, or groups of containers, can group together container images developed by different teams into a single deployable unit. 
- <b>Kubernetes</b> services provide load balancing, naming, and discovery to isolate one microservice from another. 
- <b>Namespaces</b> provide isolation and access control, so that each microservice can control the degree to which other services interact with it. 
- <b>Ingress</b> objects provide an easy-to-use frontend that can combine multiple micro‐ services into a single externalized API surface area.
