- Pod: abstraction of containers, usually 1 application per pod, each pod gets its own IP address
- Service: permanent IP address, attached to each pod, lifecycle of pod and service are not connected, communication
- Ingress: route traffic into cluster


<b>controlplane</b>: 

- API server: UI/API/CLI, only access to the cluster (cluster gateway, authentication)
- Controller manager: keeps track of whats happening in the cluster, detects cluster state changes
- Scheduler: ensures pods placement, decides on which node new pod should be scheduled (kubelet executes the request)
- etcd: k8s backing store, cluster changes get stored in the key value store

virtual network: creates one unified machine

ConfigMap: external configuration of your app (eg: db urls)

Secret: used to store secret data, base64 encoded

Deployment: a template for creating pods, for stateless app

StatefulSet: for stateful apps or database

Each configuration file has 3 parts:

1. meta data
2. specification
3. status : automatically generated by k8s (etcd holds the current status of any k8s component)

Kubelet: interact with both the container and node

Kube proxy: forwards the requests

worker nodes must install: kubelet, kube proxy, container runtime

<b>production cluster setup</b>: multiple master and worker nodes
separate virtual or physical machines

<b>minikube</b>: master (api server) and worker processes (enable pods to run on node, create/destroy pods, services) run on one node,
kubectl: cli

<b>service configuration file</b>: selector: select pods to forward the requests to
